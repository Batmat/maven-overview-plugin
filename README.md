overview-maven-plugin
=====================

Maven plugin, creating a diagram of all dependencies, dependency graph. (The entire transitive closure.) 
It supports inclusions/exclusions. Generates reports. 

Note that this plugin was previously named "maven-overview-plugin" and was developed by @neotyk.

Example showing the graph of this plugin itself (no exclusion at all, that's why this graph is quite difficult to read) :
